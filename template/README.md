# Vagrant enviroment for Template

This is template for new machines. 

#### To create new machine
```
cp -r template new-project
```

#### Usage
We share roles among projects, so we can keep all tasks together. Just include wanted roles using ```role nameOfRole```. List of roles is here ../shared/roles/. You are welcome to add new role there.

If you wanna override shared role, just create role/nameOfrole/task dir.
